## Overview

The SQL50 challenge covers a range of SQL topics. This repository is organized by the following sections:

- **Select**
- **Basic Joins**
- **Basic Aggregate Functions**
- **Sorting and Grouping**
- **Advanced Select and Joins**
- **Subqueries**
- **Advanced String Functions / Regex / Clause**

Each section has its own folder that contains:
- A **README.md** describing the question structure, difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), and any additional context.
- One or more SQL solution files (e.g., `solution1.sql`, `solution2.sql`, etc.)
